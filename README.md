EarthSavers

The EarthSavers website is a platform dedicated to raising awareness about pressing environmental issues that threaten our planet and inspiring individuals and communities to take action towards a more sustainable future. The mission is to inform, educate, and motivate people to make a positive impact on the environment. By providing valuable information, practical tips, and inspiring success stories, I aim to empower individuals and communities to contribute to the preservation of our planet.

I compressed the project's images with the help of tinyPNG website, to reduce the time it takes to load the page.
